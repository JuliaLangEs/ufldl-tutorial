# ufldl-tutorial
Stanford unsupervised feature learning and deep learning tutorial - implemented using Julia

This is based on material from the [UFLDL tutorial page](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/wiki/index.php/UFLDL_Tutorial) and [Dan Luu's solutions](https://github.com/danluu/UFLDL-tutorial.git). I plan to work through this as an educational exercise.
